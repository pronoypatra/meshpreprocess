Error Analysis Summary:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Average MSE (Min-Max): 0.00000009
Average MSE (Unit Sphere): 0.00000027
Average MAE (Min-Max): 0.00021378
Average MAE (Unit Sphere): 0.00043057

Min-Max normalization produces lower reconstruction error on average.

Observations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Quantization with 1024 bins introduces minimal information loss.
2. The reconstruction errors are very small, indicating that the
   quantization process preserves mesh structure effectively.
3. Error patterns may vary depending on the mesh geometry and
   the distribution of vertices in 3D space.
4. Both normalization methods are suitable for mesh processing,
   with the choice depending on specific application requirements.

Recommendations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- For applications requiring minimal reconstruction error, use the
  method with lower error (Min-Max).
- Consider the mesh characteristics: Min-Max is better for
  preserving scale relationships, while Unit Sphere is better for
  rotation-invariant processing.
- The quantization bin size (1024) provides a good balance between
  compression and quality. Increasing bins reduces error but
  increases storage requirements.
